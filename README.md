# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project employs machine learning to accurately predict fraudulent transactions within a credit card transaction dataset. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data, we've developed a model capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions with an impressive 99.99% accuracy, significantly enhancing the potential for preventing financial fraud.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The backbone language for performing data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Employed for insightful visualizations of the dataset's characteristics.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for implementing and evaluating machine learning models.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a comprehensive credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle, which includes a wide range of transaction data points essential for identifying fraudulent activities. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023).

## Data Analysis
An extensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify key features and trends within the data, laying the groundwork for effective model training and validation.

## Model Development
The project culminated in the development of a machine learning model that achieved a remarkable 99.99% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions. This section details the model selection process, feature engineering techniques, and the evaluation metrics used to validate model performance.
